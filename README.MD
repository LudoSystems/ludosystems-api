# Ludo.Systems API

The Ludo.Systems API is built in Spring Boot.

See the site in action at [Ludo.Systems](https://ludo.systems).

To get started, clone the repo and set it up like any other Spring Boot project. Then follow the example in `src/main/resources/config/example.application.properties` to create your own `src/main/resources/config/application.properties`.

This is meant to be used in conjunction with the Ludo.Systems app, and a Ludo.Systems database, both found on the [Ludo.Systems GitHub](https://github.com/ludosystems).
